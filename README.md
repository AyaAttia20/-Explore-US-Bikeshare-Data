# -Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
in this project I explored data related to bike share systems for three cities Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
ask and answer a set of questions, and based on that, we were able to filter the data and get information about each city for the bike-sharing system.
you can run the python file with any software program eg.Visual Studio Code 
and you can answer the questions :choose the city you want to explore its system , the month you want filter according it  and the day (if you want)
you will get the information about the bikeshare system of the city that you choose it
